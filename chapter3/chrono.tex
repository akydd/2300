\section{Chronology}
Daniel's prophetic visions are all contained within the book of Daniel.  According to tbe Biblical account, they span a xx year period, starting during the reign of King Belshazzar
and ending during the reign of King Cyrus.

In chronological order, according to the Biblical account:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Daniel's first vision (Daniel 7): First year of King Belshazzar of Babylon  4 beasts, 3.5 years for the horn of the 4th beast
    \item Daniel's second vision (Daniel 8): Third year of King Belshazzar of Babylon Ram and the goat, daily sacrifice taken away for 2300 evenings--mornings
    \item Daniel's third vision (Daniel 9): First year of Darius son of Xerxes (or Ahasuerus)  70 7s
    \item Daniel's fourth vision (Daniel 10--12): Third year of Cyrus King of Persia, 24th day of the 1st month  Son of Man, King of the North
\end{enumerate}

Combining this with the historical accounts from the previou sections is problematic as there is no extra-Biblical historical reference to King Darius, whom,
according to the text of the third vision, is the son of Ahasuerus and a Mede by descent.

Leaving the dating of the third vision aside for the moment, we arrive at the following dates for the visions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Daniel's first vision: 553 BC
    \item Daniel's second vision: 551 BC
    \item Deniel's third vision: unknown
    \item Daniel's fourth vision: 537 BC
\end{enumerate}
